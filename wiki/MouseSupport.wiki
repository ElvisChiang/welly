= Introduction =

Mouse Support is available since Welly 2.0. You can enable mouse support for a site in the bookmark setting page, or toggle it through a toolbar button. (You may need to check "Customize toolbar" in order to find the new button.)

Notice that mouse support is *only* available for _SMTH BBS_ currently. If you're browsing other BBS, such as _PTT_, enabling mouse support may lead to *unpredictable troubles*.
