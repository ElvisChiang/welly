# Introduction #

Mouse Support is available since Welly 2.0. You can enable mouse support for a site in the bookmark setting page, or toggle it through a toolbar button. (You may need to check "Customize toolbar" in order to find the new button.)

Notice that mouse support is **only** available for _SMTH BBS_ currently. If you're browsing other BBS, such as _PTT_, enabling mouse support may lead to **unpredictable troubles**.

# Click Entry #

When browsing a board, clicking on a post's title can directly jump into that post for viewing.

When browsing board list / friend list, click on an entry can directly jump into it.

In addition, the main menu items are also able to click as a shortcut.
